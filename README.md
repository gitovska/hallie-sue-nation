# hallie-sue-nation

Hallie Sue Nation is a Twitter bot that replies to people's dreams and images with generated dream sequences.

She is deployed on a Google Cloud TPU, and uses its 8 cores simultaneously with Stable Diffusion's v1.5's Image2Image pipeline.
This produces eight generated images concurrently using eight prompts based on the original tweet and generated by OpenAI's GPT3 Curie Text Generation Model.

This repository contains a Dockerfile, which will allow you to run Hallie Sue Nation in a Docker Container on a TPU equipped system.

## Set-up

Clone this repository and generate a docker image with the Docker file.
